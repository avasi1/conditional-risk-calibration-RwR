## Environment Setup

### Overview

This project uses a Python environment named `risk_calibration_RwR_env`. Follow the steps below to set it up using a virtual environment and the `requirements.txt` file.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python (version 3.9 or higher) installed. Check your Python version:
```bash
python --version
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv risk_calibration_RwR_env
```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     risk_calibration_RwR_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source risk_calibration_RwR_env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Deactivate the Environment (when done)**
```bash
deactivate
```

### Running the Code

After setting up the environment and installing all dependencies, you can run collect the experimentation results by executing the following command:

```bash
python RwR_results_script.py
```

Alternatively, you can run the notebook `RwR_result.ipynb`.

The RwR losses generated by the considered algorithms are also compared to the benchmarks from https://github.com/avasi1/RwR/tree/adjusted-version (forked from [hanzhao-wang/RwR](https://github.com/hanzhao-wang/RwR) with minor adjustments)
